# Credit Card Approvals Prediction 

![credit card](https://github.com/AchalSuresh/Creditcardapprovals/blob/main/credit_card.jpg?raw=true)

### Overview
This project leverages Machine Learning to predict credit card approval rates, helping financial institutions make data-driven decisions while minimizing risk. Using Logistic Regression and Random Forest, the model analyzes key applicant features such as income, credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and past financial behavior to determine approval likelihood..

### The Data
The data is a small subset of the Credit Card Approval dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** showing the credit card applications a bank receives. This dataset has been loaded as a pandas DataFrame called cc_apps. The last column in the dataset is the target value.

### Key Features ðŸš€
âœ… Preprocessing & Feature Engineering â€“ Cleaned and transformed raw application data for optimal model performance.
âœ… Modeling with Logistic Regression & Random Forest â€“ Compared performance of two classification models to optimize accuracy and interpretability.
âœ… Hyperparameter Tuning â€“ Used GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune model parameters.
âœ… Risk Assessment Insights â€“ Identified key factors influencing approvals, helping improve decision-making strategies.
âœ… Evaluation & Metrics â€“ Assessed models using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curves to balance false positives and negatives.

### Tech Stack ðŸ› 
ðŸ”¹ Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GridSearchCV)
ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

### Results & Impact ðŸ“ˆ
Improved approval accuracy while reducing false positives and negatives.
Provided a transparent, interpretable model for financial risk assessment.
Helped optimize credit approval strategies with data-driven insights.
